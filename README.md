# desafio_reactNative
Rocketseat's challenge involving React Native concepts. 

## Mobile functions:
Two basic functions should be available once everything is set in the Android or iOS emulator:

- List the repositories in a API(backend server): it must create a list of all the repositories that are stored in the API with the fields title, 
techs and number of likes using the pattern ${repository.likes}, only the number of likes must be dynamically changed. 
- Liking and repository stored in the API: there's a like button in the app that should allow the user to like a repository by pressing the button
with the text "Curtir" inside it. When this button is clicked, it should update the number of likes for the repository that had its button pressed.
